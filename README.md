# tartan-wallpapers
Collection of tartan wallpapers in beautiful high resolution.

Coming soon.

Thread-count data comes from three sources:
    - Smith's book of tartans
    - The Scottish Registry of Tartans
    - individuals (including myself)

To build the images, you need Perl and ImageMagick. Mac and Linux users already
have these. Windows users will have to install them, or download the pre-built images.

If you find a problem with a tartan, or want me to include another one, please open
a new issue in this project. For a new tartan, I will need
    - its name
    - color pallette as RGB hex (e.g., "red = df2020") [optional; I can use a default pallette]
    - thread counts
    - symmetric or asymmetric?
    - number in the Scottish Registry of Tartans [optional]
